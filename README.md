## 📝 About

**The Markdown Editor** is a feature-rich, browser-based Markdown editor designed for developers, writers, and content creators. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a seamless writing experience with real-time rendering, bidirectional editing capabilities, and a clean, distraction-free interface.

What sets this editor apart is its **bidirectional data binding** — you can edit content in the Markdown source or directly in the rendered preview, and both views stay perfectly synchronized. Whether you're writing documentation, blog posts, README files, or technical notes, this editor provides everything you need without the complexity.

### Why This Editor?

- **Truly Bidirectional:** Unlike traditional one-way editors, edit the preview directly and watch changes sync back to Markdown
- **Professional Grade:** Powered by Monaco Editor (the same engine as VS Code) with full syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
- **Privacy First:** Everything runs locally in your browser — your content never leaves your device
- **Zero Setup:** No installation, no sign-up, no configuration — just open and start writing
- **Lightning Fast:** Optimized rendering with Marked.js and secure HTML sanitization with DOMPurify
